there are 7 main stories that we have avaliable

* Assurgence - the third book of the series.
* The Final ARCH - the fourth book of the series.
* The New Age - the fifth and currently final book of the main series.

# SECONDARY BOOKS
Secondary books include rewrites and random writes. So essentially here at our studio we strive for perfection (mostly me), but over the course of writing the story i have been unsatisfied with it more than once. So i rewrite it usually 1 book at a time, and random writes are non-cannon parts of the story that i write while i brainstorm the next chapter of the story they can have anything happen and in one i had a character die but as i stated it is off-cannon.

* Random Writes - the secondary element with a randomness factor to them.
* Book 1 rewrite - In progress.
* The Bridge Of Time - an AU of the main universe.
