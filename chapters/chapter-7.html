      <h1>CHAPTER 7: THE HUNT</h1>

      <h3>Earth - New York City<br />Two Months After Dreius's Message</h3>

      <p>
        The USOF safe house was in Brooklyn, tucked between a laundromat and a
        bodega, unremarkable in every way. Which was exactly the point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agent Maria Torres of the FBI's Joint Alien Affairs Division had been
        watching it for three weeks. She'd seen twelve different people enter
        and leave. She'd logged their movements, their patterns, their routines.
        And tonight, based on intelligence from Agent Seraph, tonight was when
        they'd finally have enough evidence to move.
      </p>

      <p>
        "All units, stand by," she whispered into her comm. "Target is
        approaching from the north."
      </p>

      <p>
        Through her scope, she watched a man in his forties, carrying a
        briefcase, walk casually down the street. According to Assonian
        intelligence, the briefcase contained fifty thousand dollars in
        cash—payment for explosives that would be used to bomb the Assonian
        Embassy in Geneva. Again.
      </p>

      <p>The man entered the safe house.</p>

      <p>"Alpha team, green light," Torres said. "Execute."</p>

      <p>
        Four blocks away, Dr. Sarah Chen sat in a mobile command center with
        Agent Seraph, watching through surveillance feeds as FBI tactical teams
        converged on the building. This was the seventh USOF cell they'd hit in
        the past month. Each one had brought them closer to the leadership, to
        the corporate money, to the people orchestrating the entire conspiracy.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Breaching now," the tactical commander's voice came through the
        speakers.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the screens, they watched as agents in tactical gear smashed through
        doors, moved with practiced precision through rooms. Shouts. Movement.
        Then—
      </p>

      <p>
        "All targets secured. No shots fired. Repeat, no shots fired. We have
        twelve suspects in custody and... Jesus Christ, we have a lot of
        hardware here."
      </p>

      <p>
        The camera feeds showed what he meant. The safe house wasn't just a
        meeting place. It was an armory. Explosives, automatic weapons, even
        what looked like military-grade plasma rifles—Assonian technology,
        stolen or bought on black markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Bag everything," Chen ordered. "I want serial numbers, manufacturers,
        every piece of evidence we can trace."
      </p>

      <p>"Copy that, Doctor."</p>

      <p>
        Seraph leaned back in her chair, studying the suspects being led out in
        handcuffs. "That's cell seven. We have five more confirmed locations and
        possibly three we're still tracking."
      </p>

      <p>
        "How long before they realize we're systematically dismantling their
        entire network?" Chen asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "They already know," Seraph said. "The question is whether they
        accelerate their timeline or go deeper underground. Based on the chatter
        we've been monitoring, I think they're panicking. Which makes them more
        dangerous."
      </p>

      <p>
        Torres's voice came through: "We've got something. One of the suspects
        is asking for a deal. Says he has information about the leadership.
        About who's really funding this."
      </p>

      <p>Chen and Seraph exchanged glances.</p>

      <p>
        "Bring him to the command center," Chen said. "Let's hear what he has to
        say."
      </p>

      <h3>Twenty Minutes Later</h3>

      <p>
        The man sat across from Chen and Seraph, his hands still cuffed, his
        lawyer beside him. He was thin, nervous, sweating despite the cool
        temperature.
      </p>

      <p>
        "My client," the lawyer began, "is willing to provide substantial
        information about USOF leadership and operations in exchange for
        immunity and witness protection."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Let's hear what he's offering first," Chen said. "Then we'll discuss
        deals."
      </p>

      <p>
        The man—his name was David Reese, according to his file—licked his lips.
        "I can give you names. Real names. The people funding us, coordinating
        operations, planning the attacks. But I need guarantees. These people...
        they have reach. They can get to me anywhere."
      </p>

      <p>"Including in an Assonian facility?" Seraph asked quietly.</p>

      <p>
        Reese looked at her, seeing the alien features, the calm competence.
        "You're one of them. One of the aliens."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm Assonian, yes. And I'm offering you protection that no human
        organization could match. Our facilities are impenetrable. Our security
        is absolute. If you cooperate, we can ensure your safety in ways your
        government cannot."
      </p>

      <p>
        "She's right," Chen added. "The USOF has penetrated some law enforcement
        agencies, some political offices. But they haven't penetrated Assonian
        security. You'd be safer with them than with us."
      </p>

      <p>
        Reese was quiet for a moment, then: "Okay. Okay, I'll talk. But you need
        to understand, these people... they're not just terrorists. They're
        billionaires. CEOs. People with private armies and government
        connections. They've been planning this for years, since before the
        Assonians even revealed themselves."
      </p>

      <p>"Planning what?" Chen asked.</p>

      <p>
        "The long war," Reese said. "They don't want quick victory or quick
        defeat. They want perpetual conflict. Earth and Asson locked in endless
        fighting, both sides bleeding resources, neither able to win decisively.
        Because that's when they make their real money. Selling weapons to both
        sides, reconstruction contracts, security services, everything."
      </p>

      <p>
        He pulled out a data chip—somehow he'd managed to keep it hidden even
        through the arrest.
      </p>

      <p>
        "This has everything. Names, account numbers, communication logs. The
        plan isn't just to break the treaty. It's to ensure that Earth and Asson
        stay enemies for generations. And they're using that exiled Assonian
        lord—Dreius—as the trigger. When he attacks, when the violence starts,
        they profit from both sides' fear."
      </p>

      <p>
        Seraph took the data chip, her expression unreadable. "How did you get
        this?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm an accountant," Reese said. "Was an accountant. They hired me to
        manage some of the financial transfers, keep things clean, make sure the
        money couldn't be traced back to the corporations. But I kept copies.
        Insurance, you know? In case they decided I was a loose end."
      </p>

      <p>"Smart," Chen said. "And you're willing to testify to all of this?"</p>

      <p>
        "If you keep me alive, yeah." Reese looked at both of them. "Look, I
        didn't sign up for this believing in their cause. I did it for the
        money. But when I saw what they were really planning, how many people
        would die just so they could get richer..." He shook his head. "I'm not
        a good person. But I'm not that bad. Give me immunity and protection,
        and I'll burn them all down for you."
      </p>

      <p>Chen looked at Seraph, who nodded slightly.</p>

      <p>
        "Deal," Chen said. "Agent Torres, process Mr. Reese's transfer to
        Assonian custody. Agent Seraph will handle his protection personally."
      </p>

      <p>
        As Torres led Reese away, Chen plugged the data chip into her terminal.
        What came up made her blood run cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Names. Dozens of them. CEOs of major defense contractors. Executives
        from resource extraction companies. Even two sitting members of
        Congress.
      </p>

      <p>
        And financial records showing a network that spread across fifty
        countries, managing billions of dollars, all coordinated to ensure that
        Earth and Asson remained enemies.
      </p>

      <p>"This is going to cause an earthquake," Chen said quietly.</p>

      <p>
        "Good," Seraph replied. "Let it. These people tried to engineer a war
        between our civilizations. They deserve whatever earthquake is coming."
      </p>

      <h3>Courosaunt - Chancellor's Office<br />Same Day</h3>

      <p>
        Thiurate read the intelligence report with growing horror. The scope of
        the conspiracy was staggering. The USOF wasn't just a terrorist
        organization—it was a corporate-backed operation involving some of the
        wealthiest and most powerful people on Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        "How do we proceed?" he asked, looking at his father and General Arcan.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Carefully," Keeson said. "If we simply release this information, it'll
        look like we're trying to destabilize Earth's governments. We hand them
        ammunition to claim we're interfering in human affairs."
      </p>

      <p>
        "But if we don't release it," Arcan countered, "we're protecting the
        people trying to kill us. Chancellor, these corporations have been
        funding attacks on our facilities, on our people. They're accomplices to
        terrorism."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Which is why Earth needs to be the one to expose them," Thiurate said.
        He activated his comm. "Dr. Chen, you're seeing the same data I am?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Yes, Chancellor," Chen's voice came through. "And I'm already
        coordinating with President Vasquez. We're preparing a joint
        announcement. Earth will lead on the human conspirators, Asson will
        provide the evidence. That way it's clear we're not interfering—we're
        assisting Earth's investigation of its own criminals."
      </p>

      <p>"When?" Thiurate asked.</p>

      <p>
        "Forty-eight hours. We need that time to coordinate arrests, secure
        assets, prepare for the fallout. Chancellor, when this goes public, it's
        going to shake both our civilizations. People will demand
        accountability. Some will claim the evidence is fabricated. It'll be
        messy."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Messy is better than the alternative," Thiurate said. "Forty-eight
        hours. We'll be ready."
      </p>

      <p>He ended the call and turned to face his father and Arcan.</p>

      <p>
        "When this breaks, the USOF is finished," Thiurate said. "But that
        doesn't mean we're safe. Cornered enemies are dangerous, and these
        people have resources. General, I want maximum security on all our
        facilities for the next seventy-two hours. Assume they'll try something
        desperate."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Already on it, Chancellor," Arcan said. "But there's something else we
        need to discuss. Dreius."
      </p>

      <p>Thiurate felt his stomach tighten. "What about him?"</p>

      <p>
        "He's been quiet since he sent that message two months ago. No attacks,
        no movements, just building his infrastructure on Kistin. But our
        long-range sensors have picked up unusual activity in his sector over
        the last week. Multiple ships arriving and departing, weapons testing,
        mobilization patterns."
      </p>

      <p>
        "You think he's preparing to attack despite his message?" Thiurate
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I think he's preparing for something," Arcan said. "Whether it's an
        attack on us, on the USOF, or something else entirely, I can't say. But
        he's not sitting idle."
      </p>

      <p>
        Keeson spoke up. "Has he responded to any of our subsequent
        communications?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "No," Arcan admitted. "After that first message through Seraph, nothing.
        We've tried to establish dialogue, but he's gone silent."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Then we watch and wait," Thiurate decided. "If he attacks, we defend.
        But I'm not going to assume hostility just because he's mobilizing. He
        told us the USOF was now his enemy. Maybe he's preparing to deal with
        them in his own way."
      </p>

      <p>"And if his way involves civilian casualties?" Arcan pressed.</p>

      <p>
        "Then we stop him," Thiurate said firmly. "But we don't stop him
        preemptively. We're not his enemies, General. We're his alternative.
        Let's make sure we act like it."
      </p>

      <h3>Kistin - Dreius's Command Center<br />Same Time</h3>

      <p>
        Lord Dreius stood before a holographic display showing USOF cell
        locations across Earth and several other worlds. His intelligence
        network—built from scratch over the past six months—had been tracking
        them just as Asson's had.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Confirmed targets," he said to his assembled officers. "Seventeen USOF
        cells, eight corporate headquarters involved in funding, and one central
        coordination facility. All of them have been planning attacks on both
        Asson and Earth interests."
      </p>

      <p>
        "My Lord," Commander Valerius said carefully, "are we really going to
        strike human targets? That would be seen as an act of war, regardless of
        whether the targets are legitimate."
      </p>

      <p>
        "We're not striking Earth," Dreius corrected. "We're striking USOF
        facilities. There's a difference. And we're going to make that
        difference very clear."
      </p>

      <p>He pulled up another display, showing a coordinated assault plan.</p>

      <p>
        "In forty-eight hours, my brother is going to expose the USOF
        conspiracy. Earth authorities will move to arrest the leadership, seize
        assets, dismantle the organization. It'll be a joint Earth-Asson
        operation, very public, very political." He smiled slightly. "And in all
        that chaos, no one will notice that several key USOF facilities
        simply... disappear. Quietly. Permanently."
      </p>

      <p>
        "You want to hit them while Earth authorities are making arrests?" one
        of his officers asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I want to ensure that the USOF is destroyed completely," Dreius said.
        "My brother's approach will get the leadership, the public figures. But
        the USOF isn't just its public face. It has hidden facilities, backup
        plans, resources stashed in places Earth authorities will never find.
        I'm going to find them. And I'm going to eliminate them."
      </p>

      <p>He turned to face his officers.</p>

      <p>
        "Here's what you need to understand. The USOF tried to use me to start a
        war. They thought I was a blunt instrument, a useful fool who'd attack
        my brother and create the chaos they wanted. They were wrong. And now
        they're going to learn what happens when you try to manipulate someone
        who's better at this game than you are."
      </p>

      <p>
        "But Lord Dreius," Valerius said, "won't this look like you're
        cooperating with Asson? With the treaty?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "It'll look like I'm protecting my own interests," Dreius corrected.
        "The USOF was funding me with the expectation that I'd follow their
        plan. I took their money and built my forces, but I never agreed to be
        their puppet. This is me settling that account. Violently."
      </p>

      <p>He pulled up specific target locations.</p>

      <p>
        "These facilities are off Earth, in neutral territory or failed
        colonies. No civilian casualties, no Earth sovereignty violations. We
        hit them hard, we hit them fast, and we make sure there's nothing left
        for them to rebuild with. By the time my brother's public arrests
        happen, the USOF won't have any hidden resources to fall back on.
        They'll be truly finished."
      </p>

      <p>
        "And then what, my Lord?" an officer asked. "After the USOF is
        destroyed, what's our relationship with Asson?"
      </p>

      <p>Dreius was quiet for a moment.</p>

      <p>
        "Then we continue building what we're building here. We prove that order
        and strength create better societies than compromise and cooperation. We
        demonstrate that my path works. And eventually, when Asson sees what
        we've accomplished, when they see the difference between their approach
        and mine..." He smiled. "Then they'll have to make a choice. And I'm
        confident about what they'll choose."
      </p>

      <p>
        "You still believe you'll win," Valerius said, not quite a question.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I believe truth wins," Dreius said. "And the truth is that
        civilizations built on clear hierarchies, on meritocracy, on the
        understanding that some people are better suited to lead than
        others—those civilizations survive. Civilizations built on endless
        consensus-seeking and compromise? They stagnate and fail. I'm going to
        prove that. Just not the way the USOF wanted."
      </p>

      <p>He turned back to the display.</p>

      <p>
        "Prepare the strike teams. We launch in forty-six hours, two hours
        before my brother's public announcement. I want every USOF hidden
        facility destroyed before they even know we're coming."
      </p>

      <p>"Yes, my Lord."</p>

      <p>As his officers dispersed to prepare, Valerius lingered.</p>

      <p>"My Lord, may I speak freely?"</p>

      <p>"Always."</p>

      <p>
        "You're helping your brother, even though you're still his ideological
        enemy. Even though you still believe he's wrong."
      </p>

      <p>"Yes," Dreius said simply.</p>

      <p>"Why?"</p>

      <p>
        Dreius looked at the display showing both Asson's planned arrests and
        his own planned strikes. Two brothers, working toward the same goal from
        opposite directions, neither willing to admit they might need each
        other.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Because," Dreius said quietly, "my brother may be naive about how to
        build a civilization. But he was right about one thing: the USOF
        represents something worse than either of our philosophies. They don't
        believe in order or cooperation. They believe in profit through chaos.
        And that's something neither of us can tolerate."
      </p>

      <p>He paused, then continued.</p>

      <p>
        "I still think he's wrong about how to lead. I still think his treaty
        will fail, that his approach will cost lives, that eventually Asson will
        need the kind of decisive leadership I represent. But I'd rather prove
        that through success than through someone else's manipulation. When I
        defeat my brother's philosophy, I want it to be clean. Honest. A genuine
        test of whose approach works better."
      </p>

      <p>
        "That's remarkably principled for someone who claims principles are a
        luxury," Valerius said with a slight smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Principles aren't a luxury," Dreius corrected. "Naive idealism is.
        There's a difference. I have principles. I believe in order, in
        strength, in meritocracy. Those principles are why I oppose my
        brother—and why I oppose the USOF. Both threaten the kind of
        civilization I'm trying to build, just in different ways."
      </p>

      <p>He looked at his second-in-command.</p>

      <p>
        "In forty-six hours, we're going to prove that strength and order can be
        wielded against chaos rather than cooperation. We're going to show the
        galaxy that my way works. And we're going to do it without becoming the
        monster my brother thinks I am."
      </p>

      <p>
        Valerius nodded slowly. "Understood, my Lord. I'll prepare the teams."
      </p>

      <p>
        As Valerius left, Dreius stood alone, looking at the holographic display
        of two coordinated operations—one public, one hidden—that would destroy
        the USOF completely.
      </p>

      <p>His brother thought he was a warmonger.</p>

      <p>The USOF thought he was a useful idiot.</p>

      <p>
        Neither understood that Dreius, son of Keeson, was playing a longer game
        than anyone realized.
      </p>

      <p>And in forty-six hours, the entire galaxy would see it.</p>

      <h3>
        Earth - Washington D.C.<br />President's Office - 24 Hours Before the
        Announcement
      </h3>

      <p>
        President Elena Vasquez sat in her office, reviewing the arrest
        warrants. Fifty-three of them. CEOs, executives, politicians. People
        she'd worked with, shaken hands with, attended fundraisers with. People
        who'd been engineering a war while smiling to her face.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We're ready, Madam President," her chief of staff said. "All agencies
        coordinated. The arrests will happen simultaneously at 0600 tomorrow.
        The evidence is airtight."
      </p>

      <p>"And the public reaction?" Vasquez asked.</p>

      <p>
        "Will be chaos," her chief of staff admitted. "Some will call this a
        witch hunt, claim the Assonians fabricated evidence. Others will demand
        even more arrests, claim the corruption goes deeper. It'll be the
        biggest political scandal in history."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Good," Vasquez said. "These people tried to start a war that would have
        killed billions. I want chaos. I want outrage. I want everyone to
        understand exactly what was almost done to us."
      </p>

      <p>She signed the last warrant.</p>

      <p>"Execute the operation. And God help us all with what comes next."</p>

      <h3>Kistin - Dreius's Flagship - 2 Hours Before Asson's Announcement</h3>

      <p>
        "All strike teams are in position, my Lord," Valerius reported.
        "Seventeen targets confirmed. We're ready on your command."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dreius looked at the tactical display. His forces were positioned at
        seventeen locations across former Lumina space—every hidden USOF
        facility his intelligence network had identified. Small teams, surgical
        strikes, designed to eliminate infrastructure without causing broader
        conflict.
      </p>

      <p>"Execute," he said simply.</p>

      <p>
        Across a dozen worlds, Dreius's forces moved simultaneously. USOF
        bunkers exploded. Hidden weapons caches were destroyed. Communications
        facilities went dark. In less than an hour, every hidden resource the
        USOF had stashed for rebuilding after their public leadership was
        arrested simply ceased to exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        "All targets destroyed, my Lord," Valerius reported. "Zero civilian
        casualties. No Assonian casualties. Mission complete."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Good," Dreius said. "Now we wait and see what my brother does with his
        part."
      </p>

      <h3>Earth - 0600 Hours</h3>

      <p>
        The arrests happened simultaneously across six continents. FBI,
        Interpol, and local authorities, coordinated with Assonian intelligence,
        moved on fifty-three targets. By 0615, all were in custody.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 0700, President Vasquez and Chancellor Thiurate appeared together on
        a joint broadcast, explaining everything. The conspiracy, the evidence,
        the arrests. The corporate backing, the profit motive, the attempt to
        engineer perpetual war.
      </p>

      <p>The reaction was immediate and explosive.</p>

      <h3>
        Courosaunt - Chancellor's Office - 12 Hours After the Announcement
      </h3>

      <p>
        Thiurate watched the Earth news feeds with exhaustion. Protests,
        counter-protests, political resignations, emergency legislative
        sessions. Exactly the chaos his father had predicted.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was productive chaos. The kind that came from exposing corruption
        rather than hiding it.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Chancellor," Agent Seraph entered his office. "We have a problem. Or
        maybe an opportunity, I'm not sure which."
      </p>

      <p>"What is it?"</p>

      <p>
        "Seventeen USOF facilities in neutral space were destroyed last night.
        All of them hidden locations we hadn't identified yet. All destroyed
        with military precision, zero collateral damage."
      </p>

      <p>Thiurate felt his pulse quicken. "Dreius."</p>

      <p>
        "Almost certainly," Seraph confirmed. "He hit them two hours before our
        public announcement, while they were still scrambling to figure out what
        we knew. Wiped out their backup plans completely. The USOF is now truly
        finished—no hidden resources, no fallback positions, nothing."
      </p>

      <p>
        "He helped us," Thiurate said quietly. "Without coordination, without
        asking for credit, he helped destroy the USOF."
      </p>

      <p>
        "While also demonstrating his military capability and intelligence
        network," Seraph added. "Chancellor, your brother just proved he could
        hit targets across multiple star systems simultaneously with perfect
        precision. That's both helpful and terrifying."
      </p>

      <p>
        Thiurate stood, moving to the window. Out there, somewhere in the ruins
        of old empires, his brother was building an alternative civilization.
        One based on strength and order rather than cooperation and compromise.
      </p>

      <p>
        And despite being ideological enemies, despite still believing the other
        was fundamentally wrong, they'd just worked together to destroy a common
        enemy.
      </p>

      <p>"Send him a message," Thiurate said.</p>

      <p>"What should it say, Chancellor?"</p>

      <p>Thiurate thought for a long moment.</p>

      <p>
        "Tell him... tell him thank you. Tell him his assistance was noted and
        appreciated. And tell him that when he's ready to discuss what happens
        next between us, I'm willing to talk. Not as enemies. As brothers who
        disagree but don't have to destroy each other over it."
      </p>

      <p>
        Seraph nodded. "I'll send it. Chancellor, do you think he'll respond?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "I don't know," Thiurate admitted. "But I hope so. Because I'm starting
        to think that maybe—just maybe—the galaxy doesn't have to choose between
        his way and mine. Maybe there's room for both."
      </p>

      <p>"That's very optimistic, Chancellor."</p>

      <p>"I know," Thiurate said. "My father would be proud."</p>

      <h3>Kistin - Three Days Later</h3>

      <p>Dreius read Thiurate's message three times.</p>

      <p><em>Thank you. Appreciated. Ready to talk.</em></p>

      <p>Simple words. But they carried weight.</p>

      <p>
        His brother was offering dialogue. Not surrender, not alliance, but
        genuine conversation between equals who respected each other despite
        fundamental disagreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dreius could ignore it. Continue building his empire in isolation,
        preparing for the eventual confrontation when he'd prove his philosophy
        superior.
      </p>

      <p>Or he could do something unexpected.</p>

      <p>He began typing a response:</p>

      <p><em>Brother,</em></p>

      <p>
        <em
          >I don't regret what I did to the USOF. They tried to use me, and I
          don't allow anyone to use me. This wasn't cooperation with you—it was
          protecting my own interests. Our goals happened to align. This
          time.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >But I accept your offer of dialogue. Not because I think you'll
          convince me I'm wrong. Not because I'm ready to rejoin Asson or
          support your treaty. But because I'm curious what you think happens
          next.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >You have your way. I have mine. Both are being tested. Your peaceful
          cooperation with Earth, my orderly meritocracy on Kistin. Let's see
          which one succeeds in building something worth defending.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >I'll meet with you. Neutral territory. No guards, no weapons, just
          us. Two brothers talking about how to build civilizations in a
          universe that seems determined to choose violence over everything
          else.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p><em>Let me know when and where.</em></p>

      <p><em>- Dreius</em></p>

      <p>He sent the message, then sat back.</p>

      <p>His father would have been proud of Thiurate for offering dialogue.</p>

      <p>
        His father would have been disappointed in him for accepting it instead
        of pursuing total victory.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Dreius wasn't his father. He was something different. Something new.
      </p>

      <p>And maybe, just maybe, his brother was too.</p>

      <p>Time would tell which of them was building the future.</p>

      <p>But at least they'd both survived to see it tested.</p>
